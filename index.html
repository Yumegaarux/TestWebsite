        This is the picture of the great
        Jared. He has greated several structures
        in the city of Iloilo. He is one of the prime
        Dragon-lords that can be found in the region
        of Panay. He is one of the most elite Caseoh
        and Hitler fans that can be found in the island
        of Iloilo. His favorite WW2 soldier was <i>Solja
        Boy</i>. Jared also allegedly revealed that he 
        would rather eat chicken-flavored worms than worm-
        flavored chicken.

        Master jared also likes watching competitive boxing,
        last time he was interviewed, he said he doesn't like
        fake boxing and he said he'd rather punch them instead
